# SimpleRadioPropagation
Simple simulation of VHF (30 MHz to 300 MHz) radio propagation.

Only show signal strength for location with line of sight between the transmission point and the receiving point.
The simulation takes into account the height along the line between the points. Which is taken from HGT files that can be downloaded from [this site](https://dwtkns.com/srtm30m/).
